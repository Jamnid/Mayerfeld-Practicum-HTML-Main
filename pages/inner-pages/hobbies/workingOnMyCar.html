        <h3>WORKING ON MY CAR</h3>
        <p>It might sound strange to some, but I enjoy working on my car, fixing
            it, modifying it. It started as a small curiosity of how can I learn to
            fix my vehicle and understand more about such things. After a while it
            spiraled out of control and I started to enjoy working not only my car,
            but on my family's vehicles as well. I am currently slowly trying to
            modify my car's exterior!</p>
