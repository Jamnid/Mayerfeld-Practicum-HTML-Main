        <h3>GOING TO THE GYM</h3>
        <p>I enjoy going to the gym, working on my physique! Before going to the
            gym, I was actively playing basketball. I guess, I like the fact that
            gym not only helps with your physique or health, but it also teaches you
            how to be disciplined</p>
